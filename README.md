# ARTIC
Attention-based transformer model for Arabic image captioning.

This repository primarily focuses on deep learning tasks related to image captioning, employing cutting edge methods. The technique of creating a written description of an image through the use of computer vision and natural language processing is known as image captioning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in the network to encode images into latent space representations. Transformers are then used to decode feature and word representations and construct language models. Testing and training are conducted using the Arabic Flickr8k dataset.
